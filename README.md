# TTA-Sim2Real-A-Mixed-Real-Synthetic-Dataset-and-Pipeline-for-Tidal-Turbine-Assembly-Object-Detection

This repository accompanies the paper **"TTA-Sim2Real: A Mixed Real–Synthetic Dataset and Pipeline for Tidal Turbine Assembly Object Detection"**. It provides a reproducible pipeline for training and evaluating object detection models using a dataset of real and synthetic images from tidal turbine assembly operations.

Key components of the repository include:
- Scripts for training, evaluation, and inference of object detection models (YOLO-based)
- A CVAT setup for semi-automatic annotation guide
- Scripts for data preparation: data split, Conversion from unity perception annotation to YOLO format
- Instructions for environment setup and dependencies

- > ⚠️ **Note:** Full datasets are hosted on Hagging Face due to their size.
